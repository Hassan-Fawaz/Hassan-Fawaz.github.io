While helping better utilize the system's resources, full-duplex technologies have the ability to double the efficiency of wireless networks. However, these networks would suffer from added types of interferences, namely self-interference and intra-cell co-channel interference. As such, efficiently addressing scheduling and power allocation in full-duplex networks is vital. In this article, we formulate a queue-aware, fair scheduling and power allocation problem for full duplex orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks. Due to its intractability, we decompose this problem into two: a scheduling problem and a power allocation problem. We compare our proposal to the state-of-the-art, and show that it improves fairness among the user equipment at no cost in the system's performance. Simulation results show a significant increase in throughput values for full-duplex users in comparison with their half-duplex counterparts, and that power allocation saves on expenditure while improving user performance.
