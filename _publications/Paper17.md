In Half-Duplex (HD) systems, at a given time instant, a radio resource is exclusively assigned to one User Equipment (UE) either for transmission or for reception. Full-Duplex (FD) networks promise to increase the system's capacity by allocating resources simultaneously to two UEs: one uplink UE and one downlink UE. In order to enhance the network's spectral efficiency, the system needs to deal with two major types of interference: self-interference and co-channel interference. This is one of the main challenges of scheduling in FD systems. In this article, we propose two algorithms for scheduling in FD Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access Systems (FD-OFDMA). First, we propose an FD Maximum Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise ratio (FD Max-SINR) algorithm, which allocates resources in FD depending on the SINR values of the UEs. Second, we propose a Hybrid Max-SINR scheduling algorithm. This hybrid algorithm chooses astutely between allocating the resources either in HD or FD, in a manner that maximizes the SINR. We evaluate these algorithms and compare them to HD Max-SINR in terms of UE throughput and average waiting delay. According to the simulation results, FD Max-SINR provides, in comparison with its HD counterpart, increased throughput for uplink UEs. It also almost doubles the throughput for the downlink ones. FD Max-SINR reduces the waiting delay that UEs undergo. Furthermore, for relatively low values of Self-Interference Cancellation (SIC), our Hybrid Max-SINR algorithm can still provide higher network throughput compared to HD Max-SINR.
