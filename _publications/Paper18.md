Computational offloading is a pivotal solution to
several Internet of Things (IoT) issues as it helps subdue the
constrained nature of IoT devices. By harnessing the large capacity
at the Edge, IoT devices with limited battery and storage can delegate
certain tasks, especially those related to Machine Learning.
Because of their restricted capacity, such devices can only store a
limited amount of data as a training set for their learning, leading
to a faulty prediction with high error rate. To tackle that issue,
IoT devices can federate the learning process with other devices
while the Edge server acts as an aggregator. However, selecting
the appropriate Edge is a significant challenge. In fact, although
learning collectively can reduce the prediction error, it also brings
about a communication cost that depends on the selected Edge.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Non-Cooperative game
where devices autonomously and efficiently select an Edge server
in order to reduce both their learning error and communication
cost.
