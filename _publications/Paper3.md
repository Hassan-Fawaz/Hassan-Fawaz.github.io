This paper explores the use of multi-agent deep
learning as well as learning to cooperate principles to meet strict
service level agreements, in terms of throughput and end-to-
end delay, for a set of classified network flows. We consider
agents built on top of a weighted fair queuing algorithm that
continuously set weights for three flow groups: gold, silver, and
bronze. We rely on a novel graph-convolution based, multi-agent
reinforcement learning approach known as DGN. As bench-
marks, we propose centralized and distributed deep Q-network
algorithms and evaluate their performances in different network,
traffic, and routing scenarios, highlighting both the effectiveness
of our proposals and the importance of agent cooperation. We
show that our DGN-based approach meets stringent throughput
and delay requirements across different scenarios, decreasing
silver and bronze flow median waiting delays by more than 50 %
and reducing the SLA violations of the latter by nearly 60 %,
with respect to a classic priority queuing approach.
