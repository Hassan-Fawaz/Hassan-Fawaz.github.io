Computational offloading is an efficient way to help
constrained IoT devices by performing heavy tasks on Edge
servers, especially tasks related to Machine Learning. Moreover,
due to their limited learning capacity and memory size, such
devices can only store a limited amount of data as a training
set for their learning. Consequently, learning prediction is bound
to be smeared with relatively high error. To mend that issue,
IoT devices can federate the learning process with their pairs
via an Edge server. However, offloading repeatedly the learning
model through a wireless access network is time consuming.
Hence, although learning collectively can reduce the learned
model variance, it inflicts a communication cost depending on
the selected Edge server. Therefore, in this paper, we model
the Edge Selection problem as a non-cooperative game where
devices autonomously and efficiently select an Edge server to
reduce both their learning error and their communication cost.
Depending on the characteristics of the dataset, we discern two
different types of games. For each game type, we implemented and
compared a semi-distributed algorithm based on Best Response
dynamics. We compared the obtained results with the optimal
centralized approach and with a less computationally intensive
meta-heuristics, to assess the price of anarchy. Our numerical
analysis shows that the Best Response algorithm strikes a good
balance between efficiency and swift convergence.
