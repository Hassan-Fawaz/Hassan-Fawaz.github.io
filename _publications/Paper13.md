With the promise of doubling a wireless network's capacity, researchers on full-duplex wireless networks need to address multiple issues such as user equipment pairing, power control, and the availability of channel state information. In this paper, we propose a discrete simulator for scheduling and power allocation proposals in full-duplex orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks. Our simulator is queue-aware and adaptable to different scheduling objectives. It enables varying the path-loss model, user distribution, noise conditions, and throughput demands. Additionally, it permits the calculation of packet level performance metrics such as the waiting delay.
