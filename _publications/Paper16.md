Scheduling in full-duplex networks is essential for efficiently managing resources, and for mitigating interference problems. However, this task is hindered by the lack of complete channel state information. Full duplex networks need information on the radio channel in between the user equipment that current wireless networks do not provide. In this paper, we propose two queue-aware optimal algorithms, one greedy and one fair, for scheduling in full duplex orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks. We propose heuristic alternatives for these algorithms, and show that they provide near optimal performance. With two different scheduling objectives at hand, we study the impact of imperfect channel state information on scheduling in full duplex networks.
