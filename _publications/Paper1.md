This is my Thesis Dissertation. My thesis work revolved around proposing scheduling and power allocation algorithms for full-duplex wireless networks. We utlized multiple tools such as optimization, heuristics, game theory, and machine learning and considered different scenarios from single-cell to multi-cell deployements.
