In this paper, we aim to tackle the challenges of resource block scheduling and power allocation in the context of multi-cell full-duplex wireless networks. This is a more realistic setting than the single cell scenario, and it better envisions how full-duplex wireless communications could eventually be implemented. We propose an optimal queue-aware joint scheduling and power allocation algorithm for full-duplex wireless networks in a multi-cell scenario. Because of its mathematical intractability, we decouple the problem and solve it for scheduling first, and for power allocation second. We consider both indoor and outdoor scenarios and show that the gains of multi-cell full-duplex wireless networks, with respect to their half-duplex counterparts, are not always prevalent. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of inter-cell cooperation when it comes to scheduling resources and show that depending on the scenario at hand, interference mitigation from inter-cell cooperation can improve the performance of user equipment in terms of throughput and waiting delay. Finally, we show that power allocation can improve user equipment throughput with its efficiency being tied to the deployment scenario at hand.
