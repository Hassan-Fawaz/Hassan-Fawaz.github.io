Hello and welcome to my personal website. My name is Hassan Fawaz. I am a research engineer specializing in the domain of telecommunications. Here's a brief overview of my academic and professional journey:
</div>

## Education


### Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In 2015, I graduated with an Engineering degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Computer and Communications) from the Lebanese University in Beirut, Lebanon. My final year project focused on direction of arrival estimation for smart antennas in a multi-path environment.

### M2 Telecom Networks and Security
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued my M2 degree in Telecom Networks and Security in 2016 from Saint Joseph University of Beirut and the Faculty of Engineering at the Lebanese University. My master's thesis research was centered around scheduling in full-duplex wireless networks, exploring various algorithms for scheduling in full-duplex OFDMA networks.
</div>


### Ph.D. in Wireless Communications
<div style="text-align: justify;">
At the end of 2016, I was awarded a Doctoral Fellowship from the National Council for Scientific Research – Lebanon (CNRS-L), embarking on a journey to delve deeper into the realm of full-duplex wireless networks. Over the course of three years, my research addressed several critical issues in the domain, including user fairness, spectral efficiency, and CSI availability.

## Professional Experience


### Postdoc at Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Paris Saclay
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Following the completion of my Ph.D., I embarked on a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at UVSQ, Paris-Saclay, France. During this tenure, my research focused on Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly LoRaWAN. Leveraging recurrent neural networks, we proposed spreading factor assignment algorithms to optimize packet delivery rates in multi-operator environments.

### Research Engineer at Télécom SudParis - IP Paris
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Since the end of 2020, I have been working as a research engineer at Télécom SudParis, Palaiseau, France. Initially, my work revolved around proposing multi-agent deep learning-based solutions for load balancing and queue management in networks. Currently, I am involved in projects related to 5G New Radio systems, leveraging ns3-based Lena NR module and state-of-the-art 5G emulators such as Open5gs and UERANSIM.
